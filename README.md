## **Introduction**
Customer churn is a significant challenge in the airline industry. This project leverages machine learning to predict churn, analyze its drivers, and help airlines design better strategies to retain customers.

---

## **Dataset Description**
The dataset contains **10,282 rows** and **32 columns** with information on:
- **Demographics**: Age, Gender
- **Travel details**: Type of Travel, Loyalty Points, Class
- **Flight details**: Delays, Flight Distance, Cancellation
- **Customer feedback**: Likelihood to Recommend

---

## **Objectives**
- Predict customer churn using machine learning models.
- Identify key factors influencing churn.
- Provide actionable insights to improve customer retention strategies.

---

## **Methodology**
1. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**:
   - Visualized distributions and relationships among features.
   - Examined patterns influencing churn.

2. **Data Preprocessing**:
   - Handled missing values and encoded categorical variables.
   - Scaled numerical features for better model performance.

3. **Modeling**:
   - Trained models: Random Forest, Logistic Regression, Gradient Boosting.
   - Evaluated using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

4. **Evaluation and Comparison**:
   - Plotted ROC-AUC curves for model comparison.
   - Analyzed feature importance to understand churn drivers.

---

## **Key Insights**
- **Travel type**, **loyalty points**, and **delays** are significant churn predictors.
- **Random Forest** achieved the best balance of metrics.
- **Gradient Boosting** excelled in recall, identifying churn cases more effectively.

---

## **Results**
- **Random Forest**:
  - Accuracy: 81.32%
  - F1-Score: 69.81%
  - AUC: 0.67
- **Gradient Boosting**:
  - Accuracy: 80.88%
  - F1-Score: 70%
  - AUC: 0.88
- **Logistic Regression**:
  - Accuracy: 78.05%
  - F1-Score: 64.97%
  - AUC: 0.80

Gradient Boosting proved to be the most reliable for identifying churn cases.

---

## **Future Scope**
- Integrate real-time churn prediction for dynamic monitoring.
- Enhance feature engineering with customer sentiment and lifetime value.
- Expand the model to other industries or broader airline datasets.

---

## **Limitations**
- Imbalanced classes may affect recall for churn cases.
- Performance depends on the availability and quality of dataset features.
- Ensemble models like Random Forest and Gradient Boosting lack interpretability compared to Logistic Regression.

---
